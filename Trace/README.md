### Projectile Tracing

**Author:** @TheMostWSpinUser

**Description:**

The `Projectile` module provides functionality for creating and visualizing projectile paths using beams in a 3D environment, such as in a game engine like Roblox. This module calculates the trajectory of a projectile based on physical parameters and updates the visual representation of the path in real-time.

**Key Functions and Methods:**

1. **Projectile.new():**
   - Initializes a new `Projectile` object and sets up the initial beam and attachments for visualizing the projectile path.

2. **Projectile:createBeamInProjectileMotionPath():**
   - Creates a beam with two attachments to represent the path of the projectile. The beam is colored green by default and is parented to the workspace's terrain.

3. **Projectile:updatePath(player, mousePosition):**
   - Updates the path of the projectile based on the player's position and the mouse position.
   - Calculates the trajectory using a simplified projectile motion model and updates the beam's curve sizes and segment count to reflect the path.
   - Adjusts the positions of the attachments to visualize the projectile's trajectory.

4. **Projectile:beamProjectile(g, v0, x0, t1):**
   - Calculates the control points and frames for the beam to simulate projectile motion.
   - Uses physical parameters such as gravity (`g`), initial velocity (`v0`), initial position (`x0`), and time (`t1`) to determine the path.
   - Returns the curve sizes and coordinate frames for the beam's attachments.

5. **Projectile:createAndSetBeam(g, v0, x0, endTime, color):**
   - Creates a new beam with specified physical parameters and an optional end time and color.
   - Sets up the beam's properties, including curve sizes, segments, and color, and positions the attachments based on the calculated trajectory.

**Usage:**

The `Projectile` module is designed to visualize projectile motion in a 3D environment. It can be used in games or simulations where projectile trajectories need to be displayed, such as in shooting games, physics simulations, or educational tools. By updating the beam's path in real-time based on player input, the module provides a dynamic and interactive way to visualize projectile motion.

**Physics-Based Calculations:**

The module uses a simplified physics model to calculate the projectile's trajectory, taking into account gravity and initial velocity. The beam's path is updated to reflect the calculated trajectory, providing a visual representation of the projectile's motion.
